            <p class= "pl-2">For the to-be-moms around the world, sometimes knowing what is healthy for their baby isn't always clear. Although some foods and drinks like alcohol are easier to identify as harmful,
                there are also more obscure foods like cheese and chips that are less obvious and sometimes harmful in certain amounts.
                 <br> <br>
                We thought of the pregnant women that go to get groceries, sometimes unsure about which foods to get. Would this be harmful? Can I eat this much? <br><br>We wanted to create an app that could be a helping hand <b>for future moms braving the grocery aisles.</b>

            <p class="header title pt-5">The Lives of To-Be-Moms</p>
                <p>Being a mom, and caring for a child for the first time can be difficult and sometimes full of the unknown. 
                    With physical changes and fluctuations in hormones affecting mood and sometimes mental well-being, it can be really difficult to balance
                    all of these with other life duties. <br> <br>
                    Around <b>375 thousand</b> women give birth in Canada alone. During such a precious time in our lives, there are so many things to balance that it can be easy to overlook diet. To add to that, eating harmful foods is not the only thing to-be-moms are worried about. 
                    Moms are also concerned
                    about <b>weight gain, body-image</b> and <b>being too restricted in diet.</b> <br> <br>

                    <!-- In the words of a BMC study in Ontario, Canada many women expressed that: <br> "gestational weight gain guidelines were unhelpful and unrealistic". -->
                    
                </p>

            <!-- <p class="header title pt-5">What do pregnant women grapple with when it comes to food?</p> -->

            <p class="header title pt-5">An Opportunity to Help</p>
            <p> We saw an opportunity to help to-be-moms that had food struggles. However, we didn't know if what value this would provide in the eyes of real moms -- which would
                require surveying and researching further. Because at the time constraints of the hackathon,
                we had to move on to implementation and skipped the opportunity to delve deeper. <br> <br>
                After the competition was over, I was still curious and wanted to see what value moms would see in this experience. I drafted a concept summary of our "picture upload" feature and sent it out to the moms I knew.

            </p>
            <img src="images/foodbaby_opp.png" class="center title-img"/>
            <p>One of the questions asked in the form was: <br> When you were still pregnant, was food something that you often had to think about and plan? If yes, were there any specific pain points?<br><br>
            There was one response that caught my attention: <br>"Yes, due to morning sickness it was hard for me to cook or eat the food. The oil would make me feel nauseous." <br><br>
            I felt this was a pain point that could be addressed by adding small features. For example, including information about common reactions and side effects to certain foods.</p>

            <p class="header title pt-5">Low-Fidelity Prototype</p>
            <p >So after understanding a bit more, we set out to create the main user flows for this app: <b>search</b>, and <b>upload</b>.</p>

            <p class="pt-5">The first point was, what do expecting mothers need to know for food? We focused on displaying information that was quick and accurate to interpret. For example, the colour
                coded lists gave a definitive decision for each food. Specifically for yellow-listed foods (which meant that the food could be consumed, but with restrictions) the restrictions are clearly
                displayed next to the option. Specifically, the questions that were the focus of the information (after expanding into the foods) can be summarized by these questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>overall, is this good or bad for me?</li>
                    <li >in what amounts should I consume this food?</li>
                    <li >what are the specific health benefits/detriments?</li>
                    <li >what have other moms experienced cooking/consuming this food? (are there other side effects)</li>

            <p class="header title pt-5">What kind of experience is Food Baby?</p>
            <p> I wanted to create a safe space for to-be-moms, that felt easy to use but also warm and welcoming. 
                I first started by creating a stylescape and gathering reference material from Dribbble, Behance and my own stash of references.

            To provide a little context, this project was a hackathon project my team and I did for cmd-f 2021. For this hackathon, we were not allowed to bring
            in prepared ideas, so we ideated, designed and created this app within 24 hours. After the hackathon, I decided to work on this project more and flesh out the design for my own practice and understanding.

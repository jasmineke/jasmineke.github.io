Nice to meet you.</h2>I&rsquo;m Jasmine! I love <a href=https://www.instagram.com/goushiii/>digital art</a>, <a href=https://anchor.fm/hojicha>podcasting</a>, challenging friends with board games and playing badminton in my free time :)</p><p>I also love solving problems and helping people understand one another (whether that be people or tech). One of the ways I love to do this happens to be experience design.</p><p>This year will be my fourth year at the University of British Columbia studying computer science.</p><p><strong>Why design when your major is CS?</strong></p><p>Although I enjoy programming from time to time, I decided on a career in design when I could see myself asking more and more questions about the people we design for.</p><p><br>What is the purpose of software, and who are the people behind it (on both ends)?</p><p>Understanding the stories of these people and continuously improving on the craft of telling their stories is something I&rsquo;d like to keep doing.</p></div></div><div class="container footer"><br><br><hr><p><a href=https://github.com/jasmineke/jasmineke.github.io>coded by jasmine & yifei</a>&#8729;

I'm Jasmine! I love [digital art](https://www.instagram.com/goushiii/), [podcasting](https://anchor.fm/hojicha), challenging friends with board games and playing badminton in my free time :)

I also love solving problems and helping people understand one another (whether that be people or tech). One of the ways I love to do this happens to be experience design. 

This year will be my fourth year at the University of British Columbia studying computer science. 

**Why design when your major is CS?** 

Although I enjoy programming from time to time, I decided on a career in design when I could see myself asking more and more questions about the people we design for. 

What is the purpose of software, and who are the people behind it (on both ends)? 

Understanding the stories of these people and continuously improving on the craft of telling their stories is something I'd like to keep doing.

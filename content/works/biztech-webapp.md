> ## Why did we make this app?
> 
> Our team at Biztech was organizing events using google forms, spreadsheets, Hopin.to, etc. and we noticed that there was an opportunity to make this process **less cluttered** and **more efficient**. Our developer team jumped on this opportunity, and over the course of months, we worked together to create a fully-realized in-house webform.

## Who was using this form?

> 2. Executives
>
> 3. Sponsors
>
> 4. Faculty/Professionals
>
> 5. Out-of-Province Students/Visitors

Considering these were the majority of our member base, we wanted to look at our events from two sides. One side being, our attendees registering for events, and the other being executives.

### Attendees
There were multiple groups of attendees, since we had faculty, students as well as out-of-province visitors who would come to attend.
From the previous year (2019/2020), we collected data every time a student signed up for forms. During the summer, we compiled this data and analyzed for who attended our events, why, and how they found out about it.

We found that most of what we were getting our sign ups from was Facebook.


### Execs
For the organizing team, there were concerns about our event forms being spread across multiple different tools. This created a lot of friction when we registered attendees because we would go between different Google spreadsheets to cross check attendance and registration.

## How we used the database we had to optimize the form.

Seeing that we had a large database on previous years, we saw an opportunity to visualize this data and use it to make more informed decisions on our design. We found especially, that most of the students attending our events, heard of us through **Facebook** (around 53%) and signed up after following us or seeing an event post. This meant, most of the time, students had already seen the event description, got interested and wanted to sign up. 

We used this to inform the descriptions and structure of the form.

## Low & High Fidelity Prototype

I am in the process of updating my site. In the meantime, here is a gallery of some of my high-fidelity work for this project:

## What was the impact of this form?

Although we were able to make many of the designs for the developer team while still on the team, I left the team before the web form was pushed out and readily usable. 

Today (October 16, 2021), UBC Biztech uses the form to register students for their many events. With over 150+ members and multiple events throughout the year garnering up to 250 students, Biztech's web form is used by students and faculty alike.

We also reduced the amount of tools used by the team, replacing google forms and other form types (like Luma and Hopin.to) with this Biztech form.

> ## Why did we make this app?
>
> For the to-be-moms around the world, sometimes knowing what is healthy for their baby isn't always clear. Although some foods and drinks like alcohol are easier to identify as harmful, there are also more obscure foods like cheese and chips that are less obvious and sometimes harmful in certain amounts.
>
> We thought of the pregnant women that go to get groceries, sometimes unsure about which foods to get. Would this be harmful? Can I eat this much?
>
> We wanted to create an app that could be a helping hand **for future moms braving the grocery aisles**.
>
> **Duration**: {{<span class="color-dark-accent" text="24 hours">}}\
> **Tools**: {{<span class="color-dark-accent" text="Figma, Procreate, (lots of) Discord">}}\
> **Team**: {{<span class="color-dark-accent" text="Sheena Cheng, Michelle Du, Tiantian Li">}}\

## The Lives of To-Be-Moms

Being a mom, and caring for a child for the first time can be difficult and sometimes full of the unknown. With physical changes and fluctuations in hormones affecting mood and sometimes mental well-being, it can be really difficult to balance all of these with other life duties.

Around **375 thousand** women give birth in Canada alone. During such a precious time in our lives, there are so many things to balance that it can be easy to overlook diet. To add to that, eating harmful foods is not the only thing to-be-moms are worried about. Moms are also concerned about **weight gain**, **body-image** and being **too restricted in diet**.

## An Opportunity to Help

We saw an opportunity to help to-be-moms that had food struggles. However, we didn't know if what value this would provide in the eyes of real moms -- which would require surveying and researching further. Because at the time constraints of the hackathon, we had to move on to implementation and skipped the opportunity to delve deeper.

After the competition was over, I was still curious and wanted to see what value moms would see in this experience. I drafted a concept summary of our "picture upload" feature and sent it out to the moms I knew.

## Low-Fidelity Prototype

So after understanding a bit more, we set out to create the main user flows for this app: **search**, and **upload**.

{{<br>}}
{{<h2 class="normal-weight" text="Searching for food">}}
* we wanted to incorporate a basic search function, since it was recognizable and reliable
* in the case that people could not conveniently use the camera, search was a dependable alternative
* having a list made it easy to keep track of and "pre-plan" groceries

{{<h2 class="normal-weight" text="Feedback">}}
The main piece of feedback from my team (since I was working with our developers) was that the "check my food" menu that expands to "search", "upload" and "camera" felt like an extra interaction that wasn't really needed. So we kept this in mind for our next iterations.

{{<h2 class="normal-weight" text="Uploading photos">}}
* our next piece of the puzzle was identifying foods based on a photo, making it clear to use and easy
* we decided to bypass the list step for photo uploads since users usually take a photo per item to decide, rather than collect photos and assess them at the end.

{{<h2 class="normal-weight" text="Feedback">}}
One of my teammates, [Sheena](scheng.ca), pointed out that the "upload" and "camera" option together felt redundant.

We also noted that it was sometimes hard to find the home button -- so we decided for the final version to anchor the menu to the same locations.

## High-Fidelity Prototype

Heading into the final stages of the app experience, we wanted to make sure we addressed the pain points we had gathered.



> {{<h2 class="normal-weight" text="Questions I asked.">}}
>
> 1. What do expecting mothers need to know in order to make informed decisions about food?
>
> 2. What are similar applications out there already doing?
>
> 3. Which features should be included or discarded?

{{<br>}}
{{<br>}}

The first point was, what do expecting mothers need to know for food? We focused on displaying information that was quick and accurate to interpret. For example, the colour coded lists gave a definitive decision for each food. Specifically for yellow-listed foods (which meant that the food could be consumed, but with restrictions) the restrictions are clearly displayed next to the option. Specifically, the questions that were the focus of the information (after expanding into the foods) can be summarized by these questions:

* overall, is this good or bad for me?
* in what amounts should I consume this food?
* what are the specific health benefits/detriments?
* what have other moms experienced cooking/consuming this food? (are there other side effects)

## What kind of experience is Food Baby?

I wanted to create a safe space for to-be-moms, that felt easy to use but also warm and welcoming. I first started by creating a stylescape and gathering reference material from Dribbble, Behance and my own stash of references.

What kind of experience is Food Baby?

To provide a little context, this project was a hackathon project my team and I did for cmd-f 2021. For this hackathon, we were not allowed to bring in prepared ideas, so we ideated, designed and created this app within 24 hours. After the hackathon, I decided to work on this project more and flesh out the design for my own practice and understanding.

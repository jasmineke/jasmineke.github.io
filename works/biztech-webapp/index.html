Our developer team jumped on this opportunity, and over the course of months, we worked together to create a fully-realized in-house webform.</p><p><strong>Duration</strong>: <span class=color-dark-accent>4 months</span><br><strong>Tools</strong>: <span class=color-dark-accent>Figma</span><br><strong>Team</strong>: <span class=color-dark-accent>Ryan Ye, Shannon Kao, Patricia Ang</span><br><strong>Role</strong>: <span class=color-dark-accent>UI/UX Designer and Design Lead</span></p></blockquote><p><br><br><img src=/images/biztech-team.png#banner alt="Our team"></p><p><br><br></p><h2 id=who-was-using-this-form>Who was using this form?</h2><blockquote><ol><li><p>Students</p></li><li><p>Executives</p></li><li><p>Sponsors</p></li><li><p>Faculty/Professionals</p></li><li><p>Out-of-Province Students/Visitors</p></li></ol></blockquote><p>Considering these were the majority of our member base, we wanted to look at our events from two sides. One side being, our attendees registering for events, and the other being executives.</p><h3 id=attendees>Attendees</h3><p>There were multiple groups of attendees, since we had faculty, students as well as out-of-province visitors who would come to attend.
From the previous year (2019/2020), we collected data every time a student signed up for forms. During the summer, we compiled this data and analyzed for who attended our events, why, and how they found out about it.</p><p>We found that most of what we were getting our sign ups from was Facebook.</p><h3 id=execs>Execs</h3><p>For the organizing team, there were concerns about our event forms being spread across multiple different tools. This created a lot of friction when we registered attendees because we would go between different Google spreadsheets to cross check attendance and registration.</p><br><h2 id=how-we-used-the-database-we-had-to-optimize-the-form>How we used the database we had to optimize the form.</h2><p>Seeing that we had a large database on previous years, we saw an opportunity to visualize this data and use it to make more informed decisions on our design. We found especially, that most of the students attending our events, heard of us through <strong>Facebook</strong> (around 53%) and signed up after following us or seeing an event post. This meant, most of the time, students had already seen the event description, got interested and wanted to sign up.</p><p>We used this to inform the descriptions and structure of the form.</p><br><h2 id=low--high-fidelity-prototype>Low & High Fidelity Prototype</h2><p>I am in the process of updating my site. In the meantime, here is a gallery of some of my high-fidelity work for this project:</p><p><img src=/images/mobile.png#banner alt="Food Baby opp">

With over 150+ members and multiple events throughout the year garnering up to 250 students, Biztech&rsquo;s web form is used by students and faculty alike.</p><p>We also reduced the amount of tools used by the team, replacing google forms and other form types (like Luma and Hopin.to) with this Biztech form.</p><p><strong>Still curious?
